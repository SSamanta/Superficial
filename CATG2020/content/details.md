### Registering for the course

To register for the course, in addition to registering in the IISc system, you need to carry out some steps which will be explained in the first meeting. In case you are familiar with `git` and `markdown`, these are


1. have/create an account in github,
2. fork the repository https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/Superficial,
3. send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to add a file in the `contributions` folder on this repository whose name is your name in [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) with extension `md`, for example  `SiddharthaGadgil.md` and whose contents are in the same format as the example below (__note:__ there should be __no__  blank line at the top).

    ```markdown
    ---
    author: "Siddhartha Gadgil"
