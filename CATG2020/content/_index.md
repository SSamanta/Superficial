title="MA 337: Computer Assisted Topology and Geometry"
+++

The goal of this course is to build software to use computers to address various questions in Topology and Geometry, with an emphasis on arriving at rigorous proofs. The course will consist primarily of projects which will be contributions to open source software written in the __scala__ programming language. We assume good programming skills, ideally in a typed functional language such as Scala, Haskell or Idris as well as some mathematical maturity and willingness to work independently. You will also have to become familiar with the __git__ version control system.

In this semester (January 2020) the course will focus on the Topology and Geometry of surfaces, with code aggregated in the repository https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/Superficial. Suggested contributions are issues in that repository labelled [`feature-request`](https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/Superficial/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afeature-request). You are free to suggest and implement your own contribution, though it is best if you add an issue and label it `feature-request` first so it can be discussed. If you plan to work on an issue, please make a comment to avoid duplication of work.
